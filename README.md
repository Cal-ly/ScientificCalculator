# Scientific Calculator

![Icon](https://github.com/Cal-ly/ScientificCalculator/blob/master/content/iconCalcNBG.ico)

A simple yet powerful scientific calculator built using C# and WPF. This calculator supports both basic arithmetic operations and advanced scientific functions. It is designed with a clean user interface and includes a history log for tracking previous calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific Functions**: Sine, cosine, tangent, logarithms, square roots, and exponentiation.
- **History Log**: Keeps a record of previous calculations for easy reference.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for a smooth user experience.
- **Customizable**: The application is modular, with core functionality encapsulated in a separate DLL.

   - Double-click the shortcut to start using the calculator.

## Usage

1. **Basic Calculations**:
   - Use the number buttons to enter values.
   - Select an arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform basic operations.
   - Press the `=` button to get the result.

2. **Scientific Functions**:
   - Use the `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `sqrt`, or `^` buttons to perform scientific calculations.
   - Enter the value and select the desired function.

3. **View Calculation History**:
   - The history log on the interface shows all previous calculations.
   - Scroll through the log to review past results.

## Development

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cal-ly/ScientificCalculator.git
